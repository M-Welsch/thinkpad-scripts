Short introduction
==================

This collection of scripts is intended for the Lenovo ThinkPad X220 Tablet. You
can still use them with the regular X220 machine, but only ``thinkpad-rotate``
will probably be useless for you then. I think that most scripts will also be
handy for other ThinkPad models, I have not tested them though.

In short, this script fixes or improves the following:

#. Rotation of the internal screen and any Wacom touch and pen input devices
   using the bezel buttons or physical screen rotation

#. Get the microphone mute button to work.

#. Automatically use any external monitor, speakers and LAN connection when
   docking onto an UltraBase or similar.

#. Ability to disable touch pad or touch screen.
