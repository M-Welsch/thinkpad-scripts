I took the script, that served as a basis for :doc:`/man/thinkpad-rotate.1`
from a `forums entry
<http://forum.thinkpads.com/viewtopic.php?p=676101#p676101>`_ where the
original author said:

    “Put this in a file blah.sh anywhere, and do whatever you want with it!”

The changes that I made to that script are licensed under the GPLv2_.
